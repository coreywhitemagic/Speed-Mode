Your heart line is strong and clear  
This means you will lead a good life  
And be fairly happy  
A heart line that curves like this means  
It's easy for you to express your feelings  
Your head line curves towards the wrist  
This means you are creative  
A straighter line would make you  
more down to earth  
Your life line shows  
How much energy you have  
It comes across the palm  
Which means you are someone  
With plenty of stamina and energy  
Not everyone has a destiny line  
It indicates a solid direction  
And Path in life
